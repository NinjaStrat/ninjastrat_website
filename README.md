🔄 How It Works
1. Development (Source Code)
You edit files in app/ and components/
Run npm run dev to see changes live
Next.js serves your React components dynamically
2. Build Process
Run npm run build
Next.js compiles your React components into static HTML/CSS/JS
Output goes to out/ folder
We copied out/ to docs/ for GitHub Pages
3. Deployment
GitHub Pages serves the static files from docs/
Users see the compiled HTML, not your React components
⚡ Development Workflow

🚫 What NOT to Edit
❌ Don't edit files in docs/ directly
❌ Don't edit files in out/ directly
❌ Don't edit files in .next/ directly
These are generated files that get overwritten on every build.
✅ What TO Edit
✅ Edit app/page.tsx to change homepage
✅ Edit components/HeroSection.tsx to change hero
✅ Edit app/globals.css to change styles
✅ Edit tailwind.config.js to change colors
🔄 Example: Making a Change
Edit source: Change text in components/HeroSection.tsx
Test: npm run dev - see changes at localhost:3000
Build: npm run build - creates new static files
Deploy: cp -r out docs - update GitHub Pages files
Push: git add . && git commit -m "Update hero text" && git push
Think of it like this:
app/components = Your recipe (source code)
docs = The baked cake (compiled website)
You keep the recipe to make new cakes, but people eat the baked cake!
