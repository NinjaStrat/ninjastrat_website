      <h2>How STRATENGINE Works</h2>
      <p>
        STRATENGINE is our flagship automated trading strategy that implements the complete #TheStrat methodology
        developed by Rob Smith. The strategy combines pattern recognition, timeframe continuity analysis, and 
        professional risk management into a fully automated system.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Pattern Recognition Engine</h3>
      <p>
        The core of STRATENGINE is its sophisticated pattern recognition system that identifies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1 Candles:</strong> Inside bars that indicate consolidation</li>
        <li><strong>2U Candles:</strong> Bullish outside bars breaking above previous high</li>
        <li><strong>2D Candles:</strong> Bearish outside bars breaking below previous low</li>
        <li><strong>3 Candles:</strong> Directional bars continuing the trend</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Timeframe Continuity (TFC)</h3>
      <p>
        STRATENGINE analyzes multiple timeframes to ensure pattern alignment. This TFC bias helps filter
        out low-probability setups and focuses on high-conviction trades where multiple timeframes agree.
      </p>

      <h3>Risk Management</h3>
      <p>
        Every trade includes professional risk management with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamic position sizing based on account equity</li>
        <li>Predetermined risk-reward ratios</li>
        <li>Cover Risk exit strategy to lock in profits</li>
        <li>Maximum position limits to prevent overexposure</li>
      </ul>
